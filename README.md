# Edmonton Food Drive Model-Deployment 2024
## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Edmonton Food Drive App** is a machine learning-powered solution designed to predict donation bag volumes for the annual food drive organized by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This application focuses on improving operational efficiency and forecasting donation outcomes to support better planning for future food drives across Edmonton's wards and stakes.  

This project involves the full machine learning pipeline, including **data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, deployment**, and a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. **Predict Donation Bag Volumes**:  
   - Estimate the total number of donation bags per region.   
2. **Deployment**:  
   - Deliver an interactive application where stakeholders can input data and receive model predictions instantly.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Interactive Web App**:  
  A user-friendly app built using **Streamlit** to visualize data insights and provide real-time predictions.  
- **Advanced Forecasting Models**:  
  Utilizes regression models trained on historical food drive data for accurate prediction.  
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**:  
  Includes robust EDA to uncover trends, optimize workflows, and ensure high-quality model performance.

## 🚀 Machine Learning Pipeline  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Aggregated data from past food drives.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:  
   - Removal of outliers, missing value imputation, and feature engineering.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Insights into donation patterns and route performance.  
4. **Model Development**:  
   - Regression models for bag prediction. 
5. **Model Deployment**:  
   - Hosted on Streamlit for user interaction and visualization.
